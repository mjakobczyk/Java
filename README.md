# MorseTranslator

The name of the project is MorseTranslator. It basically allows user to translate texts
from latin to morse and from morse to latin.

Project was implemented in Java in a few different forms:
- client-server desktop application
- web desktop application
- mobile android application

Each form serves another purpose and uses different mechanics. Dealing with all of them
gave an opportunity to learn JavaEE and mobile applications.
